#Stock Price Prediction App
A web application that predicts the closing stock price based on the given opening price, high price, low price, and volume using a Linear Regression model. The app is built using Gradio and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

Features
Interactive UI: Enter stock data and instantly predict the closing price.
Visualization: A clean and simple layout for user input and output.
Machine Learning: Powered by Scikit-learnâ€™s LinearRegression model.
Free Hosting: Hosted permanently on Hugging Face Spaces.
How It Works
Input:
User provides four stock parameters:
Opening Price
High Price
Low Price
Volume
Model:
The app uses a trained Linear Regression model to predict the closing price.
Output:
The predicted closing price is displayed as the result.

Model Details
The model was trained using a Linear Regression algorithm from Scikit-learn. Below are the details:

Dataset
The data used for this project is from Googleâ€™s stock market history, containing:

open: Opening price of the stock.
high: Highest price of the stock.
low: Lowest price of the stock.
volume: Total number of shares traded.
close: Closing price of the stock (target variable).
Training
The dataset was split into:

80% Training Data
20% Testing Data
Key performance metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [Insert Value]
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): [Insert Value]
